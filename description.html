            <p>"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier,
                I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 pound notes. When I was alone once more,
                however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I
                could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
                which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was
                a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
                misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
                consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
                the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.</p>
            <p>"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious
                a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and
                why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should
                find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
                carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out
                of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at
                Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had
                taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</p>

            <p>"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the
                situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I
                have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute
                reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has
                only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and
                has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who
                have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have
                found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</p>

                <li>"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.</li>

                <li>"'In my own bureau.'</li>

                <li>"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.</li>

                <li>"'It is locked up,' I answered.</li>

                <li>"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I
                    have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'</li>
